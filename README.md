# Deep Learning and Digital Signal Processing for Environmental Sound Classification

ESC-10 Dataset: We are going to use ESC-10 dataset for sound classification. It is a labeled set of 400 environmental recordings (10 classes, 40 clips per class, 5 seconds per clip). It is a subset of the larger ESC-50 dataset

https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50/

Each class contains 40 .ogg files. The ESC-10 and ESC-50 datasets have been prearranged into 5 uniformly sized folds so that clips extracted from the same original source recording are always contained in a single fold.

We develop our own pre-processing techniques.
