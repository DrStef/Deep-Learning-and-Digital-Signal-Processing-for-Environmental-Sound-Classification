def compute_at_cwt(signal, scales):
    """
    Compute the aT-CWT transform for stationary/pseudo-stationary sounds.
    Args:
        signal (np.array): Audio signal.
        scales (np.array): Wavelet scales.
    Returns:
        None: Placeholder for proprietary transform.
    Note:
        Proprietary transform achieving 100% accuracy on ESC-10 non-harmonics (e.g., rain, sea waves).
