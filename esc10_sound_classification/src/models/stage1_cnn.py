    """
    Placeholder for Stage I CNN to classify harmonics vs. non-harmonics.
    Args:
        input_shape (tuple): Input shape (e.g., (128, 128, 1) for Mel-spectrograms).
        num_classes (int): Number of classes (default: 2).
    Returns:
        None: Placeholder for implementation.
    Note:
        Stage I is not implemented in the provided Notebook, likely an exercise.
        Intended to pre-classify ESC-10 clips into harmonics (e.g., helicopter) vs. non-harmonics (e.g., rain).
